# üåê Decentralized Uptime Monitor

A blockchain-empowered, regionally-distributed uptime monitoring platform with real-time analytics and alerts.


----



## üöÄ Overview

Decentralized Uptime Monitor is a next-generation website monitoring system leveraging distributed nodes, blockchain technology (`Solana/web3.js`), and global geolocation to deliver highly accurate, tamper-resistant uptime metrics. By collecting data from nodes stationed in different regions and persisting proofs to Solana, the platform offers unparalleled transparency and reliability‚Äîgreatly surpassing traditional, single-origin monitoring tools.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Decentralized Monitoring**: Multi-region nodes coordinated via blockchain for trust and auditability.
- **Global Analytics**: Accurate region-by-region uptime, latency, and health metrics.
- **Blockchain Writes**: Uptime proofs and downtime evidence optionally logged to Solana.
- **Fast API & Dashboard**: Responsive Express-powered endpoints and UI.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: WebSocket integration for fast frontend updates and Nodemailer-powered email alerts.
- **Geolocation Intelligence**: Each node tags status with its true location (powered by `ip-api.com`).
- **Scalable**: Easily add more nodes to cover new regions and increase monitoring fidelity.
- **Modern Dev Processing**: Built, tested, and managed using `Bun`.

## üèó How It Works

1. **Node Agents**: Distributed `Node.js` services fetch target URLs, timestamp results, and query `ip-api.com` for current location.
2. **Aggregation & Validation**: Results are published via `Redis` and processed by the central coordinator.
3. **Data Storage**: All checks, statuses, and event logs flow into `PostgreSQL` via `Prisma ORM`.
4. **Blockchain Logging**: For proof, select status changes are written to Solana via `web3.js`.
5. **Validator Rewards:** Validators who successfully submit and validate accurate region-checks receive SOL token rewards directly to their Solana address.
6. **Live Dashboard**: Users experience real-time website health live via `WebSocket` updates.
7. **Alerting**: Failures/downtime trigger instant notifications to users (via email using `Nodemailer`).

## üí∏ Validator Incentives and SOL Payments

- **Earning SOL:**  
  Validators are compensated in SOL tokens for their participation, based on the accuracy of their uptime/downtime reports and consensus with other node validators.
- **Payout Mechanism:**  
  Incentive distribution is automated and on-chain‚Äîvalidators periodically receive SOL payouts to their registered Solana addresses after their contributions are verified.
- **Join as a Validator:**  
  Anyone can run a node agent from any region, register a Solana address, and begin validating for rewards.
- **Transparency:**  
  All incentive transactions and validator proofs are viewable on [Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com).

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v16+ recommended)  
- **Bun** (v1+)  
- **PostgreSQL server** (local or remote)  
- **Redis server**  
- **Solana wallet** and API key for blockchain interactions  
- *(Optional)* Docker, for containerized deployment  

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BAHUBALI2550/DecentUptime.git
   cd decent_uptime
   ````

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
Create a .env file in the project root (copy the provided .env.example if available):
```env
   # Server
PORT=3000

# PostgreSQL
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/uptime_db

# Redis
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Email Notifications
EMAIL_USER=your-email@example.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password

# Geolocation API
IP_API_URL=http://ip-api.com/json/

# Solana / Blockchain
SOLANA_KEYPAIR_PATH=/path/to/keypair.json
SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com

# Node Location
NODE_REGION=us-east-1

   ```

4. **Run Database Migrations**
    ```bash
   bun prisma generate
   bun prisma migrate deploy
    # or
    bun prisma migrate dev

   ```

5. **Launch the application**
    ````bash
    bun start
    ```



## ‚ö° Usage

- Register and configure monitoring targets in the web dashboard or via API.
- Deploy node agents in target world regions (physical, VPS, cloud, etc.).
- Monitor health, uptime, and region-specific latency in real-time via the dashboard.
- Subscribe to downtime alerts via email and dashboard notifications.
- Expand coverage by recruiting new node operators for geographic redundancy.
